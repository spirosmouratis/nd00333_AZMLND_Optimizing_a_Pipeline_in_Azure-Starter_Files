# Optimizing an ML Pipeline in Azure

## Overview
This project is part of the Udacity Azure ML Nanodegree.
In this project, we build and optimize an Azure ML pipeline using the Python SDK and a provided Scikit-learn model.
This model is then compared to an Azure AutoML run.

## Summary
**In 1-2 sentences, explain the problem statement: e.g "This dataset contains data about... we seek to predict..."**
*Based on the information we are seeing on the data the problem we are getting called to solve is "If an individual*
*can be accepted or not for a loan application*

**In 1-2 sentences, explain the solution: e.g. "The best performing model was a ..."**
Inverse regularization parameter - A control variable that retains strength modification of Regularization by being inversely positioned to the Lambda regulator.


## Scikit-learn Pipeline
**Explain the pipeline architecture, including data, hyperparameter tuning, and classification algorithm.**
*We use stratify because we have an imbalanced datset when it comes to our target variable and we want to have a nice*
*distribution of both classes in our train and test sets*

**What are the benefits of the parameter sampler you chose?**

**What are the benefits of the early stopping policy you chose?**

## AutoML
**In 1-2 sentences, describe the model and hyperparameters generated by AutoML.**
The BanditPolicy basically states to check the job every 2 iterations. If the primary metric (defined later) falls outside of the top 10% range, Azure ML terminate the job. This saves us from continuing to explore hyperparameters that don't show promise of helping reach our target metric.

## Pipeline comparison
**Compare the two models and their performance. What are the differences in accuracy? In architecture? If there was a difference, why do you think there was one?**

## Future work
**What are some areas of improvement for future experiments? Why might these improvements help the model?**
*A very important area of work for future improvement for the model is ethical. We have to understand if the model*
*behaves the same for everyone (Women,Men,people of any colour and for minorities). The model will understand the underlining mathimatecal*
*connections between the data points but if the data points contain social biases inside them then it is the machine learning engineer*
*who need to counter these biases*
